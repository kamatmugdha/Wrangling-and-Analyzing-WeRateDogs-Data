#  Wrangling and Analyzing WeRateDogs Data
 
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered the data for tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs from three different sources and formats. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
The data was later cleaned for both quality and tidiness issues, lastly, it was stored as one clean master dataset, visualized and analyzed.
